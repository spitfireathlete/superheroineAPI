Esraa Abdel Fattah|Esraa Abdel Fattah|Policy Advocate|Esraa co-founded the April 6 Youth Movement in Egypt 2008, a group made to support the workers in El-Mahalla El-Kubra, an industrial town, who were planning to strike on April 6. This group gradually became an important political movement.|Esraa's name was put forward for the 2011 Nobel Peace Prize and in 2011 she won Woman of the Year by Glamour?|I advise young people, not only after 25 January, that we should participate in all political affairs in Egypt. We should participate not only by talking, but by actions. We should be a part of political parties. We should participate in elections. We should have the courage to say there is corruption, and the courage to stop everything wrong we see. We should participate in all fields in Egypt and then the people will build the new Egypt.|I started my activism in 2005, during the presidential election and when Ayman Nour was arrested. I feel that I should be involved in the political life. I wanted to send a message to the government that you can’t arrest anyone who just says their opinion. I wanted to say my opinion. I’m not happy with being silent about all the corruption around me. I started to be an activist through the Al-Ghad party because I thought it was a young party, caring about the young people, and the majority of the members of this party were my age. I like [Ayman Nour’s] courage. I like that he insists on his rights, insists to be active to send a message to the people that the president should be changed, not just one person this whole time.|We need to change how people in our society think about women,” says Esraa. “All of society will benefit, not only women. I should participate in building my country.|@Esraa2008|Chun-Li|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fJVwKd_OBi4|27890|10503

There really isn’t anything quite as satisfying as building a product where you really enjoy the end result.|At Boston College, I pursued Theatre, always keeping my web skills sharp, often making websites for friends and non-profits. I also took a Web Application Development class in the spring of my sophomore year. Then, as most Americans know, the economy took a big hit in 2008-2009. I managed to get a post-junior-year internship in the scenic-construction industry, but all the signs of a slowing industry were present. Once senior year rolled around and the Arts & Entertainment industries were not doing well, I decided to focus on my other passion, Tech.|"I love solving big problems on small screens. I love getting my hands dirty with product development, UX, and code. Ultimately, I just love making apps."|@micheletitolo|Phoenix|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EN11bcZ3heA|54000|20564

Fernanda Borges|Fernanda Borges|Political Leader|Borges was born in East Timor. She got Bachelor's Commerce degree in Economics and MBA in Business law and PSM from both University of Wollongong and the University of New England. She was appointed as Minister of Finance in 2001 under the Special Representative of the Secretary-General, Dr. Sergio Vieira de Mello for the United Nations Transitional Administration in East Timor.|Fernanda is fluent in three languages - Tetum, English, and Portuguese?|There is something else I’d like to ask of you: in order to uphold the rule of law, in order to have justice for the terrible things that were done to our people, especially our women, during the occupation of our country, I hope you will speak up for justice for East Timor at every opportunity. International law is supposed to guarantee that those who committed war crimes and crimes against humanity face justice. We must have an international tribunal for those who committed such serious crimes. It is also important to deny a visa to those suspected of serious crimes.|When Fernanda Borges was a young girl in Argentina, thousands of people began “disappearing” into thin air. For several years, the military dictatorship would wage a campaign of state terrorism against left-wing activists, guerillas and sympathizers.Bearing witness to the frightening potential of unchecked power, Fernanda's early political consciousness formed around the notion that good governance meant being accountable to the citizenry. She joined a political party, and then a local public administration. But she grew frustrated by the corruption behind the opaque walls of government halls. Armed with a degree from the London School of Economics, FernandaLaur returned home to Argentina to put her political ideals into practice. She headed up Poder Ciudadano (Citizen Power) one of Argentina’s leading government watchdog organizations, before her election to Congress in 2008, where she represents Buenos Aires for the PRO Party.|Being a woman in a largely male-dominated political class in East Timor, I tend to be more willing to listen, and to think about issues a lot more. I have learnt to not be scared of questioning things. I try - and I think women tend to do this - to drill into the details a lot more.|@vitalvoices|WonderWoman|http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QLpzMRsyRT0|87690|78656
